          The goal of the game is to find all 5 pairs of cards as quickly as possible. The player that finds the greatest numbers of pairs, wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click any card in the card pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of Beyoncé. Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and you will have completed a match! If they don’t, you’ll have three seconds to look at them before they flip back over. Then it’s time for the other player to try!
        </p>
        <p>
          After you play, you’ll see the name of the final winner and how long it took to win the game.
